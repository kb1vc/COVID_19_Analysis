All points (except for Australia) shown on the map are based on geographic centroids, and are not representative of a specific address, building or any location at a spatial scale finer than a province/state. Australian dots are located at the centroid of the largest city in each state.\n",

    "* <b>Recovered</b>: Recovered cases outside China are estimates based on local media reports, and state and local reporting when available, and therefore may be substantially lower than the true number. US state-level recovered cases are from [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/).\n",

    "* <b>US Hospitalization Rate (%)</b>: = Total number hospitalized / Number confirmed cases. The \"Total number hospitalized\" is the \"Hospitalized â€“ Cumulative\" count from [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/).
